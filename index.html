Hello World

The text above was entered on the command line, use something like "Hello World" > index.html (as per 
the instructions I was following along), and then I added the new file to that git repo, committed the change and pushed
it out to GitHub.

At some point the README.md page for this blog repo was created, I suppose by GitHub, and it contains some information
and suggestions.  One of which was that you can use this rather clunky GitHub editor on their web-site to edit
you page content using markdown syntax.

Now, what do I remember about markdown?  I seem to recall that *GitHub* markdown is a specialized flavor
#I also think that there may be headings, which might be indicates with an pound/ocotothorpe/hash.
So then this would be regular text maybe.
